## LAND Smart Contract

![LAND](https://farmland-game.github.io/land.png)

For the base LAND token we've kept it as simple and basic as possible. This token is a standard ERC-777 implementation and was deployed on Ethereum mainnet with fixed supply of 57,706,752 LAND. To bootstrap the ecosystem we will distribute the LAND will be released in several tranches, by continent:

## Continental Breakdown

| Continent | Land |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Africa | 11,662,080|
| Antarctica | 5,376,000|
| Asia | 17,118,336|
| Europe | 3,909,120|
| North America |  9,488,256|
| South America |  6,850,560|
| Australia | 3,302,400|
| Overall | 57,706,752|

The founding team will be allocated 5% of each continent as it's released & a further 5% will be allocated for expenses as they arise. The first continent to be released will be Australia which accounts for just over 5% of the total supply of LAND.
